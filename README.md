# krist-miner
The second fastest open source CPU Krist miner, written in Go.

## Performance
This miner is up to 3.5x faster than [YTCI Krist Miner](https://github.com/Yevano/ytci-krist-miner/).
It is at least 2.5x faster than YTCI Krist Miner.

On my Macbook Pro 15-inch Retina (Mid 2014) which has an Intel Core i7-4870HQ, running with 8 processes gives me speeds around 18 MH/s.

This miner has a very light memory footprint of < 3 MB. Whereas YTCI miner requires a Java VM which has a much larger overhead.

## Binaries
Binaries can be found under [releases](https://github.com/1lann/krist-miner/releases).

## Usage
Execute the binary in a terminal or command line for help.

## Donations
I don't even know why I'm bothering to put this section here, but if for some reason you would like to send me some virtual currency that has almost no value, feel free to send some KST to me for whatever reason.

## GPU Miner?
A GPU miner written for OpenCL is in the works, it may or may not ever be completed.
